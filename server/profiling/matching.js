/*
 *  MATCHING
 *  (Used as part of a Promise chain in the authentication module for handling new users.
 *  Invoked after the new user's  experience profile has been built in /profiling/index.js)
 * 
 * This implements an incredibly rudimentary matching algorithm, essentially by establishing a user's
 * nearest neighbours. It does this by finding the 'distance' between the new user and every other
 * across several dimensions and using the Pythagorean theorem to squash that distance down into one dimension.
 * I'm not very mathsy, so if you think that any element of this is silly or wrong... you're probably right!
 * 
 * THINGS TO FIX:
 * 
 * Currently, this is composed of a number of asynchronous components and only a few users, so the computationally
 * expensive components are A) not too expensive and B) frequntly interrupted by other requests. Consequently, this won't
 * make the server unresponsive. However, as the number of users grows, node's single threaded model may cause problems here.
 * Possible solutions are to:
 *  --Keep the server responsive by having multiple threads handle requests using cluster.fork();
 *  --Offload this processing to a separate thread once the user is authenticated using child_process.fork();
 *  --Run this as a cron job, regularly checking for new users and matching them.
 *
